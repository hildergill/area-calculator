(Apologies in advance if the project is a little messy)

## What's this?

As the description, this is a *simple website to calculate area of shapes/polygons*.

This website uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical rendering **only**. Besides that, I only use vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript
